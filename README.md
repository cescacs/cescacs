- 👋 Hi, This is @cescacs, the C'escacs game repository

C'escacs is a hexagonal chess variant :chess_pawn: which is played in a 169 hexes board, forming a regular hexagon.

The rules are very similar to those of orthodox chess, adapting the movements to the hexagonal board.
It is also true that there are some differences and some new pieces (elephants, dragons and pegasus).

- 📫 How to reach me: C'escacs web URL is now [published at https://cescacs.orgfree.com](https://cescacs.orgfree.com).
There can be found the rules of the game, and also this software.
