# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, This is @cescacs, the C'escacs game repository

C'escacs is a hexagonal chess variant :chess_pawn: which is played in a 169 hexes board, forming a regular hexagon.

The rules are very similar to those of orthodox chess, adapting the movements to the hexagonal board.
It is also true that there are some differences and some new pieces (elephants, dragons and pegasus).

- :desktop_computer: Developing planning: now some mini-max (alpha-beta prune) for suggesting a move, using Rust Webassembly... but I've not much time to develop the game.
